Added JS function for creating todo-lists. Need to add unique IDs to the todos arrays to link them with the todo-list divs.

Fixed Drop Down Menus.

Need to add function to the New List button to create a new todo-list div.

Working on setting an active todo-list to be displayed. All todo-lists without the active class are display=none.
