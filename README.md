<h1>Google Shopping List inspired Todo-List Web Application</h1>
<h2>Made with Javascript, HTML, and CSS</h2>

This project is the result of my first dive into learning JavaScript. After following along with numerous courses about HTML and CSS, and after completing a few beginner projects like static websites and interface clones, I felt ready to integrate a proper programming language into my studies.

I studied the basics of Javascript first, focusing on arrays and object literals, for + while loops, filtering, conditionals, and more.

While learning new languages, I am constantly surpised at how much we can do with just a few lines of code. Whenever there is a task or problem to solve, there is always a way to do it, and I find this scavenger hunt trial and error process to be so rewarding.

After learning the JS basics, I watched a JS walkthrough video that showed me how to build the basic skeleton of the todo-list web app. At the end of the video, I thought "This is ok, but I want mine to look like that! (looking at Google's Shopping List web app)" So, that was task from that day on. I spent the next month creating my Google Shopping List inspired Todo-list, adding as much functionalty as I could.

<h2>Tasks:</h2>

Uniformity across internet browsers.

CSS styling while editing a todo.

Look into dark theme option.

<h2>Updated:</h2>
The Dropdown menus for the title buttons (sort, more,...) are fixed so that only one dropdown menu can be seen at a time.
