<h1>Google Shopping List inspired Todo-List Web Application</h1>
<h2>Made with Javascript, HTML, and CSS</h2>

This project is the result of my first deep dive into learning JavaScript. After following along with numerous courses about HTML and CSS, and after completing a few beginner projects like static websites and interface clones, I felt ready to integrate a proper programming language into my studies.

I studied the basics of Javascript first, focusing on arrays and object literals, for + while loops, filtering, conditionals, and more.

While learning new languages, I am constantly surpised at how much we can do with just a few lines of code. Whenever there is a task or problem to solve, there is always a way to do it, and I find this scavenger hunt trial and error process to be so rewarding.

After learning JS basics, I watch a JS walkthrough video that showed me how to build the basic skeleton of the todo-list applicaton. At the end of the video, I thought "This is ok, but I want mine to look like that! (looking at Google's Shopping List web app)" So, that was task from that day on. I spent the next month creating my Google Shopping List inspired Todo-list, adding as much functionalty as I could.

<h2>Tasks:</h2>

Empty fields on the document should not be allowed. Maybe text inputs required, or display an error message when trying to submit an empty text field.

CSS styling while editing a todo.

Look into dark theme option.
