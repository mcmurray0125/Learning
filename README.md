Added JS function for creating todo-lists. Need to add unique IDs to the todos arrays to link them with the todo-list divs.

Added function for New List button to create new todo list.

Current Task: Convert sidebar elements to radio buttons to allow user to select an active todo-list.
When radio button is selected, that todo-list becomes active, and then new todos are appended to that active todo-list.

Additional functions like deleting all todos and renaming the todo-list can be applied to the active todo-list.
