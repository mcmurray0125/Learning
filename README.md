<h1>Google Shopping List inspired Todo-List Web Application</h1>
<h2>Made with Javascript, HTML, and CSS</h2>

This project is the result of my first dive into learning JavaScript. After following along with numerous courses about HTML and CSS, and after completing a few beginner projects like static websites and interface clones, I felt ready to integrate a proper programming language into my studies.

I studied the basics of Javascript first, focusing on arrays and object literals, for + while loops, filtering, conditionals, and more.

While learning new languages, I am constantly surpised at how much we can do with just a few lines of code. Whenever there is a task or problem to solve, there is always a way to do it, and I find this scavenger hunt trial and error process to be so rewarding.

After learning the JS basics, I watched a JS walkthrough video that showed me how to build the basic skeleton of the todo-list web app. At the end of the video, I thought "This is ok, but I want mine to look like that! (looking at Google's Shopping List web app)" So, that was task from that day on. I spent the next month creating my Google Shopping List inspired Todo-list, adding as much functionalty as I could.

<h2>Tasks:</h2>

Uniformity across internet browsers.

Media Queries for small screen sizes.

CSS styling while editing a todo.

Look into dark theme option.

<h2>Updated:</h2>
When creating or renaming a list, the input field is cleared when user clicks Save or Create button.

Characters counter now works on the Rename List text input. Before, only the New List input hada character counter.
